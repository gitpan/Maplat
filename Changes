0.994 Sun Oct 17 20:40:00 2010
    - Pass Perl::Critic level 3
    - Perl::Critic Allow a max. of 7 arguments in function definitions (although varargs aren't counted)
    - Allow newlines in strings (used mostly for SQL commands). In this, i disagree with Perl::Critic. 
      While newlines in strings aren't pretty, they are WAY better than those awfull heredocs
    - Fixed lexically reused variable names (found by Perl::Critic)
    - Ingore Perl::Critic policy Variables::ProhibitPackageVars. I completly disagree with Conway on that, as long as they are used as defined interfaces.
    - Allow "set" as function name in Perl::Critic (for our case, it isn't ambiguous)
    - Fixed Perl:Critic "Capture variable used outside conditional"
    - Use non-capturing groups where capture not required in regexp
    - use croak() instead of die()
    - Fixed "hard tab" issue for Perl::Critic
    - Fixed ref problem
    - Fixed debuglog
    - Fixed FTPSync
    - Fixed missing "use"
    - Disable usage of broken HTML::FormatText. This might brake our online office modules
    - Fixed POD format
    - Added basic support for includes in config files
    - PostgresDB can now include auth info from external XML file
    - Fixed display of version/buildnum in web
    - Switched from YAML::Syck to YAML::XS
    - Updated copyright date
    - Added MemCachePg support for workers
    - Migrated webfrontend from Storable to YAML
    - Fixed file endings to unix in all perl files
