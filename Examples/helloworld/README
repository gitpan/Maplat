This is a simple "Hello World" example on how to
use the maplat framework.

This example doesn't do much usefull things, it basically
just shows how to write a *very* simple webgui module and
run some basic workers

To run this example, you have to create a postgresql database,
see the two included SQL files.

Run the webgui:
perl webgui_cmd.pl configs/webgui.xml

Run a basic worker (cleans out directories):
perl worker_cmd.pl configs/worker.xml

Run a basic admin worker (works on database admin command
send from the webgui):
perl worker_cmd.pl configs/adminworker.xml
