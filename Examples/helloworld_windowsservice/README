This is a simple "Hello World" example on how to
use the maplat framework.

This is basically the same as the "helloworld" example. The main
difference is, this example includes an additional script (build.pl) to compile
webgui and worker with ActiveState's perlapp. It also provides a simple
windows service script (compiled with perlsvc) to run as windows service which
starts and stops the workers and the webgui.

WARNING: Due to various possible bugs, this might not work at all. At least on
one of the tests, maplat_svc turned into a fork-bomb and crashed the computer.

There are also two *.manifest files included. These are required on windows, so
the PostgreSQL driver DBD::Pg can be loaded.



To get up and running, you have to do only a few more steps:

*) Compile the programs (this assumes the PDK binaries are in your PATH):
> perl build.pl webgui worker svc

*) Edit configs\svc.xml and correct the paths (must be absolute paths to the
location where you installed the files).

*) Install the windows service (path to its config file must also be absolute;
command must be run with Administrator privileges)

maplat_svc.exe --install --config="C:\full\path\to\configs\svc.xml"

*) Optionally edit the service settings (you may want to automatically start
the service at windows startup and/or run it as different user):
> services.msc

*) Start the service
net start MaplatSVC


When you had enough:

*) Stop the service
net stop MaplatSVC

*) Uninstall
maplat_svc.exe --remove
