=head1 NAME

Maplat - The MAPLAT Web Framework

=head1 SYNOPSIS

This Module is actually a stub (don't use it). The Maplat Framework is
divided into various parts, mainly Maplat::Helpers, Maplat::Worker and
Maplat::Web. Please see these modules for more detailed information

=head1 DESCRIPTION

There are currently three parts of the Framework.

Maplat::Web is the WebGUI system, i.e. the part of the framework that
helps you render the webbased graphical interface. Maplat::Web is based on
HTTP::Server::Simple::CGI and has (alpha level) support for SSL and preforking.

Maplat::Worker is the background system. All long-running tasks (more than a
second or so) should be done with one or more background worker.

Maplat::Helpers is a library of modules with various helper modules like special
date parsing, sendmail-a-file and things like that.
