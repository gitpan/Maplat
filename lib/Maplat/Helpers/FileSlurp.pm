=head1 NAME

Maplat::Helpers::FileSlurp - read in whole files from filename

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Maplat::Helpers::FileSlurp qw(slurpTextFile slurpBinFile);
  
  my @lines = slurpTextFile('HelloWorld.txt');
  my $bindata = slurpBinFile('camel.jpeg');

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This Module provides convinience functions to slurp in files. On text files, it
also tries *very* hard to fix line endings, split the file correctly into lines
and return an array of already chomp()'ed lines.

=head2 slurpTextFile

Takes one argument, the filename. It reads in the file in binary mode, fixes the
line endings, breaks up the file into individual lines and returns an array of
already chomp'ed lines. There might be some special cases where this doesn't work
(most likely in files where multiple empty lines have mixed file endings), but so far
it worked for me.

=head2 slurpBinFile

Takes one argument, the filename. It reads in the file in binary mode and returns
its contents as a single scalar. This function also tries very hard to work on all
operating systems (especially on Windows where there are multiple, differently broken
versions of perl.exe available).
