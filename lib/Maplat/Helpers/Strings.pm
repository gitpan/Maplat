=head1 NAME

Maplat::Helpers::Strings - special string handling functions

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Maplat::Helpers::Strings qw(tabsToTable normalizeString);
  
  my $tableline = tabsToTable($text, @lengths);
  my $newstring = normalizeString($text);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module is home to some specialized functions for modifying strings. Most people wont need this
but i find them rather helpfull in some cases.

=head2 tabsToTable

This function turns a tab delimated text string into a space-padded line suitable for printing ascii-art tables.

Takes two arguments, a $textstring with multiple fields delimated by tabs, and an array with field lengths. The second
argument is an array of desired field lengths.

Example:

  my @length = (5, 8, 7);
  my @spies = ("007\tBond\tJames", "008\tDoe\tJohn");
  ...
  foreach my $spy (@spies) {
    print tabsToTable($spy);
  }

Prints out:

  007  Bond    James
  008  Doe     John

=head2 normalizeString

Removed unneeded whitespaces as well as all other non-word characters from a string.

Takes one argument, a text string and returns a "normalized" version of this string.
