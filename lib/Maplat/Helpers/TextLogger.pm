=head1 NAME

Maplat::Helpers::TextLogger - log to STDOUT and a logfile

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Maplat::Helpers::TextLogger qw(tabsToTable normalizeString);
  
  my $logger = new Maplat::Helpers::TextLogger(
                    appname    => "myApp",
                    logfile    => "yada.log"
                );
  $logger->log("Something happend");
  $logger->alive; # Notify the user that we're still alive

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a helper module to log to STDOUT as well as to a text file with the current date and time
prefixed to the logline.

=head2 new

  my $logger = new Maplat::Helpers::TextLogger(
                    appname    => "myApp",
                    logfile    => "yada.log"
                );

appname is the application name or some other unique identifier. logfile is the filename
of the logfile we want to use.

=head2 log

Takes one argument, the text we want to log.

=head2 alive

Log a "application_name is alive" log line. Use this if your program prints our log lines very
infrequently to show that the application is still running. Every 5 to 10 minutes or so is a good rule
of thumb.
